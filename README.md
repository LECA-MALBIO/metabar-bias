This project contains the data and analysis scripts linked to the paper:

***Towards quantitative DNA Metabarcoding: A method to overcome PCR amplification bias***

by Moinard et al.

All raw data files are processed with the scripts in data_processing.Rmd.

Analyses are done in the scripts in metabar_bias.Rmd and with the Julia scripts inference_metabarcoding.jl and inference_pcr_efficiency.jl
(explained in metabar_bias.Rmd).
